### Computer Vision RPS

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock. The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins. This is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera.

## Milestone 2
The computer-vision-rock-paper-scissors uses an image project model with four different classes namely: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Nothing. The rock is represented by a fist, the paper is represented by an open palm, scissors is represented by two raised fingers while nothing is represented by no symbol or action. Teachable-Machine technology is used where images for each option are taken and then trained. To increase the model accuracy, several images of each class are taken from diffenet directions. Once satisfied with the model, the model is downloaded through the 'Tensorflow' tab containing the labels.txt and keras_model.h5 files.
